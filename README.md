# Savage Roar

An AzerothCore module for giving Druid's the love they have long deserved.

While all the private servers a infested w/ over-powered Paladins, those of us who actually love the Druid class continue to get shafted by 20 years of developer blindness.  This module seeks to rectify that mistake on my private server by giving Druids a passive Savage Roar buff while shapeshifted, granting a totally legit and balancing +30% increase to damage.

This is my first attempt at creating a module.
