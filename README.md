# Savage Roar

An AzerothCore module for giving Druids the love they have long deserved.

While all the private servers are infested w/ over-powered Paladins, those of us who actually play a different class continue to get shafted by 20 years of developer blindness.

Nobody cares about imbalance when everybody plays the same class.

This module seeks to rectify that mistake on my private server by giving Druids a passive Savage Roar buff while shapeshifted, granting a totally legit and balancing +30% increase to damage.

This is my first attempt at creating a module.
